## 📁 Project 1: Cache System Performance Evaluation

### Overview
This project evaluates the performance of cache memory in symmetric multiprocessor systems using the SMPCache Simulator. Various configurations and protocols (MSI, MESI, DRAGON) were tested, and performance metrics such as hit/miss rates were analyzed.

### Tools Used
- SMPCache Simulator
- Windows 11 (via UTM)
- Excel/Manual calculation for metrics

### Key Outcomes
- Detailed comparison of coherence protocols
- Analysis of bus traffic and local/global hit rates
- Insights into system bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
